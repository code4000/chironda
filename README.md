Hello Michael

I've rebuilt the database as you asked and haven't deleted any migrations this time, learned my lesson :)

Admin Login:

Email: Chironda@admin.pt
Pw: password

For the homepictures to work, I have included it but in case its not there create a single entry into the homepictures table filling all columns in order 
to be able to edit it and change the website pictures.

Also, the contact form is not working , i was hoping u could help me on this by telling me the right gem.

let me know if everything is fine.

cheers!
